# OSRSGuesser

A location guessing game for Old School RuneScape. Inspired by GeoGuessr, OSRSGuesser is a game where you guess where on the map the given picture is. You get points based on how close your guess is!

The daily OSRSGuesser resets at Midnight GMT.

## Contributing

Have an idea for a location? Submit an issue on Github with the location you have in mind and I will look to add it.

Want to take the picture on your own and have yourself featured? Install the Client Resizer plugin on RuneLite to set your RuneLite window to 1280x720. Then use the built in RuneLite screenshot functionality to get a screenshot.

### Notes

- Make sure it is just you in the screenshot, might want to turn on the entity hider plugin and configure it appropriately.
- Make sure no tiles are highlighted and no text appears in the top corner of your window, IE take your mouse off of the RuneLite window.
- Your character should be facing the camera, but angle and zoom amount are up to you!
